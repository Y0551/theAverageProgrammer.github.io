				<p> &nbsp I graduated from university in 2020 with a Bachelor Of Computer Science and Computer Applications with a Minor In Mathematics & Statistics.
				</p> 
				<p> &nbsp The thing I enjoy most about programming and mathematics is solving problems with a limited set of rules. 
				There is no greater feeling than solving a difficult problem. A lot of people do not realize how much of 
				an art mathematics and programming is. Writing out a mathematical proof or coding some sort of solution to solve a problem is kind of magical. 
				</p>
				<p> &nbsp  The website is split into two parts: One, the home page which acts as my programming journal. 
				Two, the notes page which will have all of my programming notes which can be used hopefully as a resource. 
				The theme of the “the average programmer” is that of someone typing their notes on a typewriter. 
				I wanted the site to be simple and easy to navigate. Sometimes simplicity is the best design. I first started coding the site in HTML and CSS. 
				You need to start somewhere. I hope to code the site in javascript and then in react. 
				</p>
				<p> &nbsp I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has helped me achieve my goal of graduating university. 
				This includes my parents, my professors, the people who work at the student success center, my fellow students and anyone else who has aided me in my journey. 
				I am not the easiest student to deal with, so the help I received is very much appreciated.
