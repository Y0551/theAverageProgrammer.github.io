					<h3>Post Number 3</h3>
					<small> Where do I go from here </small> 
					<p> &nbsp Finding a job is really hard. During my time at university I never really thought about it, but now that I am going through it I can tell you with certainty it's a real pain. I often find myself complaining about the process. I even thought about writing a whole post about it, but after much thought. I realized that it won’t get me anywhere. Like someone recently told  me “no one cares” and they are right. No employer wants to hear you complain. All they really wanted to know is if you can bring some value to the company.  
					</p>
					<p> &nbsp THE AVERAGE PROGRAMMER was supposed to be something that I could show potential employers. A project that really showcases my abilities as a programmer. However, as it stands now THE AVERAGE PROGRAMMER is just a blog and really only shows my ability as a writer.

					<p> &nbsp The question I keep asking myself is do I continue working on THE AVERAGE PROGRAMMER or do I abandon ship and work on some side projects. I don’t have a good answer, but I decided that I really want to see my vision of THE AVERAGE PROGRAMMER come to fruition. In the short term this might not be the best decision, but I truly believe in the long term it will be the more beneficial one. 
					</p>
					<p> &nbsp Giving up and doing nothing is definitely worse. Like the American author Gena Showalter says  “Giving up is the only sure way to fail.”  You can’t let the disappointment of the recruitment and hiring process drag you down. Something will come up. The question is will you be ready ? and that's what I am trying to do. Trying to prepare myself so that when that interview comes I will be ready.

					<h3>Post Number 2</h3>
					<small> Why I Chose To Create A Website & Not A Youtube Channel </small> 
					<p> &nbsp A great way to test if you understand something is by explaining it to somebody else. This can be done verbally or through writing. I am not a big fan of recording myself, so a youtube channel or podcast is out of the question. In addition, when I learn something new I find it very helpful to write it down. Throughout my academic career I tried very hard to write good notes, and I hope that this website will allow me to share them with you. 
					</p>				
					<div id="more-less2"> <a onclick="toggleOnOff(2)">See More</a> </div>
					<div hidden id="restOfParagraphs2">
					<p> &nbsp However, whenever I write something down it never sounds like how I intended it to sound? No matter how much I try it's always the same story. I have an idea that I want to convey, so I write it down, but when I read it back to myself it just doesn't sound right. There is something missing. I cannot tell you the amount of time I spent reading and rereading things I wrote trying to get them to be perfect. To tell you the truth I don’t think it's possible, but at some point you just have to hope that the points you are trying to make are clear, and that someone who is reading them understands them and appreciates them. I think William Knowlton Zinsser said it best “Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time. Remember this in moments of despair. If you find that writing is hard, it’s because it is hard.” 
					</p>
					<p> &nbsp An important aspect of coding is writing good comments. Students who are learning to code very often omit this practice. I think it has to do with the fact that expressing yourself in a clear and concise manner is difficult. Having this website, forcing myself to write and to write technically will hopefully help me write better comments and better documentation, and is a benefit that I would not have had if I choose to create a youtube channel or a podcast.

					<h3>Post Number 1</h3>
					<small> Why I Created This Website </small> 
					<p> &nbsp It’s very common for computer science students to work on side projects. Many students create their own website’s, build interactive games, or code small useful programs to help them with everyday tasks. I spent most of my time and energy focusing on school. 
					</p>
					<p> &nbsp In university there is a big focus on theory. As a result you can feel kind of lost once you graduate. I know I do. Trying to land my first job has proven to be harder then I anticipated. The best thing I can do at this point is to continue to learn and to improve as a programmer. Like math, programming is not a spectator sport. You have to actually practice. You have to code on your own. If you want to be great at something you have to work hard at it. Like Lebron James says, “Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.”

						<p> &nbsp During the summer of the pandemic as I was reviewing some of my notes the idea of this website came to me. It is sort of a combination of many ideas that I had put into one. I always wanted to build my own website, publish my notes from school, and create something useful and meaningful.
						</p>
						<p> &nbsp I noticed there are a lot of content creators out there, and most of us spend so much time consuming their content. I wanted to create content not for the sake of content rather content that is useful and insightful. I want to share my experience as an up and coming programmer. I hope that by documenting my life as an average programmer I will inspire some other programmers who are experiencing similar obstacles and help them overcome them.    
						</p>
						<p> &nbsp
						The problem with starting anything new is figuring out where to start. I am someone who likes to learn things from the ground up. This leads to starting things from the beginning. I first thought of creating this website using React, but to properly learn React in my opinion you need to properly learn JavaScript, so I decided to build the site using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I hope to fully learn JavaScript from the ground up and then build the site in React. This allows me to build something that people can see right away. Like Alan Cohen once said “Do not wait until the conditions are perfect to begin. Beginning makes the conditions perfect”.
