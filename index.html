					<h3>Post Number 1</h3>
					<small> Starting something new </small> 
					<p> &nbsp It’s very common for computer science students to work on side projects. Many students create their own website’s, build interactive games, or code small useful programs to help them with everyday tasks. I spent most of my time and energy focusing on school. 
					</p>
					<p> &nbsp In university there is a big focus on theory. As a result you can feel inadequate. You can feel like you do not have the necessary skills to succeed. Like math, programming is not a spectator sport. You have to actually practice. You have to code on your own.

						<p> &nbsp During the summer of the pandemic as I was reviewing some of my notes the idea of this website came to me. It is sort of a combination of many ideas that I had put into one. I always wanted to build my own website, publish my notes from school, and create something useful and meaningful.
						</p>
						<p> &nbsp I noticed there are a lot of content creators out there, and most of us spend so much time consuming their content. I wanted to create content not for the sake of content rather content that is useful and insightful. I want to share my experience as an up and coming programmer. I hope that by documenting my life as an average programmer I will inspire some other programmers who are experiencing similar obstacles and help them overcome them.    
						</p>
						<p> &nbsp
						The problem with starting anything new is figuring out where to start. I am someone who likes to learn things from the ground up. This leads to starting things from the beginning when I really should start from the middle. I first thought of creating this website using react but to properly learn react in my opinion you need to properly learn javascript, so I decided to build the site using HTML, CSS, and some Javascript. I hope to fully learn javascript from the ground up and then build the site in react. This allows me to build something that people can see right away. Like Alan Cohen once said “Do not wait until the conditions are perfect to begin. Beginning makes the conditions perfect”.
