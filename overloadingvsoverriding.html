			<h3 class="middle"><u> Overloading Methods Vs Overriding Methods </u></h3>
			
			
			<p> &nbsp When you use inheritance, the extended class inherits all of the attributes and methods from the base class. 
			Some of these methods may be useless to the extended class. The extended class can fix this problem by either
			overloading the useless methods or overriding them. </p>
			<p> &nbsp Overloading a method is not the same thing as overriding a method. An overloaded method has the same name as the original method, but not the same parameters. In other words the signature betweeen the two methods are different. An overridden method must have the same name and the same parameters. Two methods that override each other have to look identical (same return type, same name, and same signature).
			</p>
			
			<h4 class="post-container"> <u> An Overloaded Method </u> </h4>

			<p> public Boolean equals (int a) // Original Method <br>
				public Boolean equals (int a, int b) // Overloaded Method (Different Parameters) </p>
			</p>
 
			<p> &nbsp If you try to change just the return type, you will get an error. </p> 
			
			<p>
			public <strong> int </strong> equals (int a, int b)  <br>
			public <strong> Boolean </strong> equals (int a, int b)  
			</p>
			
			<p> &nbsp If you want to use an overloaded method, you can call it directly because it is public and anyone can call it. 
			</p>
			
			<p> <strong> Note: </strong> When a derived class overloads a method, it still inherits the original method from the base class. </p>
			
			<h4 class="post-container"> <u> An Overridden Method </u> </h4>
 
			<p> &nbsp Overriding a method does not mean destroying the parents's method. It just means suppressing the parents’s method. </p>
	
			<p> public void setEmployeeName(String name) // Original Method (Base Class) <br>
			    public void setEmployeeName(String name) // Overridden Method (Child Class) </p> 

			<p> <strong> Note: </strong> If you want to call a suppressed method (an overridden method) you need to use the keyword super (super.methodName()). For example if you have two methods called setEmployeeName, if you want to call the parent's setEmployeeName use  
			super.setEmployeeName() if you want to call the child’s setEmployeeName (overridden setEmployeeName) use setEmployeeName() or this.setEmployeeName(). </p> 
			
			<h3 class="middle"> <u> Covariant Return Type </u> </h3>
			
			<p> &nbsp In Java 5.0 you can change the return type of an overridden method to that of any descendent class of that returned type. 
			For example you can have a method called x and it returns an Employee object. 
			You can have the same method x in a child class (overridden), but the return type can be an HourlyEmployee object. 
			This is because a hourly employee is an employee.
			</p> 
			
			<p> public Employee getEmployeeName()  // The base class method (original method) <br>
			public HourlyEmployee getEmployeeName() // The derived class method (still an overridden method) 
			</p>

			<p> &nbsp You can also change the overridden method’s access rights from restrictive to less restrictive, 
			but not from less restrictive to more restrictive. More on this later. 
			</p>

			<p class=post-container> <strong> Private ➡ Protected  ➡ Public </strong> <br> 
			(You can <strong> not </strong> go the other way) <br>
			<strong> Public x Protected x Private </strong>
