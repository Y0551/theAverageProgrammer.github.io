	"paragraph one": "Finding a job is really hard. During my time at university I never really thought about it, but now that I am going through it I can tell you with certainty it's a real pain. I often find myself complaining about the process. I even thought about writing a whole post about it, but after much thought. I realized that it won’t get me anywhere. Like someone recently told  me “no one cares” and they are right. No employer wants to hear you complain. All they really wanted to know is if you can bring some value to the company.",
	"paragraph two": "THE AVERAGE PROGRAMMER was supposed to be something that I could show potential employers. A project that really showcases my abilities as a programmer. However, as it stands now THE AVERAGE PROGRAMMER is just a blog and really only shows my ability as a writer."
